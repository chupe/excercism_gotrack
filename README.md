# excercism_gotrack

This repo serves as record of my first attempts at Go.

The idea is to write Go code for some (if not all) of the exercises found on exercism.org on the Go track. My goal is to get more intimately familiar with the concepts explained there, as well as practice writing Go code.

My solutions are far from perfect, hence the value in writing them down - self-improvement over time.

I would also like to give props to the team at exercism.org! They have made the journey a lot more involving for a beginner like myself!
